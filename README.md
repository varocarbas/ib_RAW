# ib

**--- CURRENTLY UNDER DEVELOPMENT ---**

Library easing the automated communication with Interactive Brokers (IB).

Required external dependencies:
- My accessory library for Java ([https://github.com/varocarbas/accessory_java_RAW](https://github.com/varocarbas/accessory_java_RAW)).
- IB API libraries (v. 9.76.01) and a running instance of their workstation/gateway.
- MySQL Java connector (v. 8.0.21).

# \_RAW repositories
All the \_RAW repositories include code which I use for personal purposes. The overall structure and used conventions are assumed to be more than enough for an experienced programmer to adequately understand and appreciate everything. 

# authorship & copyright
I, Alvaro Carballo Garcia (varocarbas), am the sole author of each single bit of this code.

Equivalently to what happens with all my other online contributions, this code can be considered public domain. For more information about my copyright/authorship attribution ideas, visit [https://customsolvers.com/copyright/](https://customsolvers.com/copyright/).
